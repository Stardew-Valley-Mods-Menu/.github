## 🌾 Overview: What the Mod Menu Brings to the Table

At its core, the Stardew Valley Mod Menu is a configurable in-game overlay that gives players access to advanced gameplay controls in real time. Think of it as a hidden greenhouse behind the scenes—quietly optimizing growth while you focus on creativity.

Unlike rigid trainers or save editors, this menu integrates dynamically, allowing you to toggle features as you play. Whether you’re testing farm layouts, experimenting with combat balance, or simply easing the grind after your tenth year in-game, the tool adapts gracefully.

## 🚀 Setup Guide: From Seed to Sprout

Getting started is refreshingly simple:

1. Install **SMAPI** (latest version recommended)
2. Drop the Mod Menu files into the `/Mods` directory
3. Launch Stardew Valley through SMAPI
4. Open the menu using the assigned hotkey (customizable)

Example configuration snippet:

ToggleKey = F5
OverlayOpacity = 0.85

```

Within minutes, the menu becomes a quiet companion—there when needed, invisible when not.
